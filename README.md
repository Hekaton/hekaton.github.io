# hekaton.github.io
The hekaton main site

## Note
Requires SASS to build scss files.

Install with `npm i -g sass`

Use with `sass --watch scss/:css/`

Since this is a static one-pager, "running" the website doesn't require anything special, just open the `index.html` file in your browser of choice.
